# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Hi! I'm Logan Gleed and I use he/him pronouns. I'm a first year at UCI from Long Beach and games have always been a huge part of my life. I grew up playing Pokemon and other Nintendo IP, but I've expanded to play pretty much anything! Currently, I play on PC and love Overwatch 2, Valorant, and the Horizon game series. I'm primarily taking this class because it is required for my major because I want to focus more on the design aspect of Game Design rather than the programming side, but I know it will be beneficial to have this knowledge. In high school I took AP Comp Sci Principles and made a dating sim for my AP Portfolio and my senior year I took an Honors Programming class in which we made several games across platforms and programming languages (although I've forgotten most of it if I'm being honest). In the future I hope to build narrative driven games (although not necessarily RPGs) as well as songs that somehow incorporate my other areas of interest such as volleyball, dance, and singing.

2. GDIM

3. Refresh my knowledge of programming and increase my proficiency beyond my prior knowledge.

4. I'm just nervous about the fact I've essentially forgotten how to program and I'm going to have to relearn it all this quarter

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. C#, C++, Python

2. Unity, Unreal Engine

3. I have used Unity before

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. N/A

2. Keeping the breadth of a project in check so that it doesn't become too overwhelming

3. A different version

4. N/A

5. N/A
